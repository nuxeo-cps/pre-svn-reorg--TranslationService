0.3

 - Don't bomb if an interpolation string has an unknown ${substitution},
   just leave it in the resulting string.

 - Don't bomb if, there is a non-ASCII pure string that got passed as a
   substitution. This can happen because of Localizer if
   LOCALIZER_USE_ZOPE_UNICODE is unset (Localizer 0.9.3), or if the
   template has a non-ASCII string in it.

0.2

 - Rename from PersistentTranslationService to TranslationService.

 - Now fully use the Zope 2.6 framework.

0.1
